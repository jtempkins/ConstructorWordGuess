# ConstructorWordGuess

#Unsuccessful attempt at creating a word guess game. I continually struggle with taking the letter guessed and replacing a dash array with correctly guessed letters from a randomly selected word.

#The game successfuly selects a word and allows the user to input a letter to begin play.
#Pseudo Code: Take the users input of a single letter, check it against the random word. When the user's input is successfully matched against the random word letter array it is inserted into the dashed array in it's proper place to work toward correctly spelling the word. Once all letters are guessed, the player is notified that they have correctly guessed the word and asks for replay? The game begins again.
